A covert channel management, integration, and implementation platform for Python 3.
Written by Justin Berthelot, Samuel Dominguez, Daniel Munger, and Christopher Rice.

Each cloak (covert channel implementation) is modularized such that they can be interchanged with the cov3rt framework.
Cloaks can be created through usage of a standard format for interface with the framework.
